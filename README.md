# LogisticRegressionKit With GeneticAlgorithm 

Welcome to the LogisticRegressionKitWithGeneticAlgorithm repository! This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for logistic regression, enhanced with the power of genetic algorithms. Whether you're new to logistic regression or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to be a valuable resource for leveraging the combined capabilities of logistic regression and genetic algorithms in your machine learning projects.



# Contents


- Linear Logistic Regression: Implementation of linear logistic regression for binary classification tasks.

- Non-linear Logistic Regression: Implementation of non-linear logistic regression using techniques such as polynomial features or kernel methods.

- Genetic Algorithm: Integration of genetic algorithms to enhance the performance and optimization of logistic regression models.

- Examples: Example datasets and code snippets to demonstrate the usage of logistic regression with genetic algorithms.
